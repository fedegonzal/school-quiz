# School Quiz

## Description

This is a simple quiz application that allows users to answer questions and get a score at the end, growing their knowledge in the process, crossing different levels of difficulty.

I made this app guiding ChatGPT-4o with prompts, you can see the entire conversation [here](docs/chatgpt-conversation.pdf).

Since the application is going complex now, I will continue coding manually. But to be honest, 90% of the code was generated by ChatGPT. The first version took me 2 hours: writing the prompts, testing the app, asking for improvements, and so on.

You can see the ChatGPT offered version as a tag in the repository.

## Features

The application is divided into three screens:
1. Create player (or select an existing one)
2. Answer questions for the current level
3. Once the level is completed, the user is congratulated and can move to the next level

## Technical details

### Create player

The screen ask the user to input a name and click start to continue, or select an existing one from a list of players stored in the localStorage.

### Answer questions

The questions are displayed one by one, with a list of possible answers as tags buttons below the question. The user can click on the answer they think is correct, and the application will show if the answer is correct or not. Once the user click the answer, no matter if it is correct or not, the next question is displayed. The questions are shown following the order defined in the json file (can be randomized or not, depending on the level-config). The possible answers order is always randomized for each question.

Each level takes a pool of correct answers to be completed (defined into the json file for each level). Once the user reaches this number, the level is completed and the user is congratulated, showing the score and the option to move to the next level.

### Next level

The user can click the button to move to the next level, and the application will show the next level of questions. If the user has completed all the levels, the application will show a message congratulating the user for completing the quiz.

### Data structure for the subject, questions and levels

The application uses a json file to store the subjects, following this format:

```json
[
    {
        "Subject": "Math",
        "Description": "Math questions for primary school",
        "QuestionsFile": "math.json"
    },
    {
        "Subject": "Science",
        "Description": "Science questions for primary school",
        "QuestionsFile": "science.json"
    }
]
```

The questions are stored in the `quiz/` folder in the following format. For example the `quiz/math.json` file could have this content (this is just an example, the application can have more levels and questions):

```json
[
    {
        "Level": "Newbie",
        "RequiredScore": 20,
        "Randomize": true,
        "Questions": [
            {
                "Question": "What is 2 + 2?",
                "Answers": [
                    {
                        "Answer": "4",
                        "Correct": true
                    },
                    {
                        "Answer": "3",
                        "Correct": false
                    },

                "Answers": [

                        "Correct": false
                    },
                    {
                        "Answer": "8",
                        "Correct": false

                        "Correct": false
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Data storage strategy

The application uses the localStorage to store the players and their scores. The data is stored in the browser, so it is not lost when the user closes the browser. The data is stored in the following format:

```json
{
  "players": [
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "scores": [
        {
          "level": 1,
          "score": 20
        },
        {
          "level": 2,
          "score": 20
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
